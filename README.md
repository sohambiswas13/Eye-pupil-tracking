# Eye-pupil-tracking
A computer vision based solution for the patients who are unable to speak or move their body parts but are able to move their eyes.
This algo detects the eye pupil movement and will trigger several speeches by gazing on the selected phrase.
Hugely inspired by google accessibility service and look to speak application.
