# Eye-pupil-tracking
A computer vision based solution for the patients who are unable to speak or move their body parts but are able to move their eyes.
This algo detects the eye pupil movement and will trigger several speeches by gazing on the selected phrase.
Hugely inspired by google accessibility service and look to speak application.
The algo is still in progress and is able to detect the eye gestures. Triggering the action is still in progress and will be updated soon.
Dlib, open cv have been used mainly for the face recognition, facual land marks and computer vision part.
